# Project Overview

This project was completed in Jupyter Notebook with Python, Pandas, Plotly and NumPy. The purpose of this project was to analyze the website analytics of the Grammys website vs. the Recording Academy website. They used to be one website but were later split into two and the Grammys want to know if they should keep the websites separate or merge them again. I had to advise them of the best course of action through the calculation of some key metrics and visualizations with Plotly. A list of tasks that I completed in this project include:

- Split a data frame into two data frames to separate the combined website data and Grammy website data
- Used a for loop to iterate over a list of data frames and create a new column for page views per session in each one
- Used a function in combination with a for loop to calculate the bounce rate for each website
- Used Plotly to make multiple charts that visualized data such as age demographics, page views per session, and visitors over time
- Provided the Grammys with a data-driven business decision to keep the websites separate as they were shown to be servicing different groups
- Compared Grammys website data with AMAs website data to check KPI performance against competitors
